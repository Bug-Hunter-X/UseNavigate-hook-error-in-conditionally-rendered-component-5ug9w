The solution is to refactor the component to ensure that the component using `useNavigate` is always rendered, even if its contents change.  This can be done by using a functional component to wrap the conditional logic:

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const [shouldRender, setShouldRender] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate an async operation that changes the render condition
    setTimeout(() => setShouldRender(true), 1000);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {shouldRender && (
        <button onClick={() => navigate('/home')}>
          Go Home
        </button>
      )}
      {!shouldRender && <div>Loading...</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```
By wrapping the conditional rendering logic inside a single functional component, we ensure that the `useNavigate` hook always exists within a component that's part of the React Router's context, even if the button itself isn't initially visible.
